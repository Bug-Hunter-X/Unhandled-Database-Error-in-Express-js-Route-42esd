# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  unhandled errors during database operations within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

**Problem:** The original code lacks error handling for cases where the database query fails to retrieve user data. This can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

**Solution:** The corrected code includes a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle potential database errors, sending an appropriate error response to the client in case of failure.
